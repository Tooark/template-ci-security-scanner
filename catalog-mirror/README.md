# Mirror project for a self-hosted CI/CD Catalog

GitLab only lists components that live in a project on the GitLab instance
itself, so a GitHub repository cannot be published to the catalog directly.
This directory holds the pipeline for a small mirror project that closes that
gap: it watches releases of
[`Tooark/template-ci-security-scanner`](https://github.com/Tooark/template-ci-security-scanner),
copies `templates/` across when the version moves, and publishes the new
version to the internal catalog.

GitHub stays the source of truth. Nothing is authored here.

## What the pipeline does

| Job       | Trigger                              | What it does                                                                                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `sync`    | weekly schedule, manual run, or push | Reads the newest upstream release; if that version has no tag yet, commits the new `templates/` and pushes the tag |
| `release` | the tag pushed by `sync`             | Publishes that tag to the CI/CD Catalog                                                                            |

Re-running `sync` when nothing changed is a no-op, so the schedule can be as
aggressive as you like.

The `release` job runs `glab`, which the `release` keyword uses on GitLab 18.0
and later. On an older instance, switch its image to
`registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release-cli`.

## One-time setup

1. **Create the project** on your GitLab instance, for example
   `tooark/ci-security-scanner`. Give it a **description** — the catalog
   refuses to publish a project without one.

2. **Seed it** with this file as `.gitlab-ci.yml` at the repository root:

   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.example.com/tooark/ci-security-scanner.git
   cd ci-security-scanner
   curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tooark/template-ci-security-scanner/main/catalog-mirror/.gitlab-ci.yml
   git add .gitlab-ci.yml
   git commit -m "chore: add catalog sync pipeline"
   git push
   ```

   `templates/`, `README.md`, `LICENSE` and `VERSION` arrive with the first
   sync — there is no need to copy them by hand.

3. **Mark it as a catalog resource**: _Settings > General > Visibility, project
   features, permissions_ and turn on **CI/CD Catalog project** (Owner role).
   The project becomes findable only after the first release is published.

   Do this before the first tag pipeline runs. The `release` job publishes to
   the catalog only when the toggle is already on; turning it on afterwards
   does not publish releases that already exist.

4. **Create a project access token** with the `write_repository` scope and the
   Maintainer role, so the `sync` job can push commits and tags. Add it under
   _Settings > CI/CD > Variables_ as:

   | Variable             | Value                    | Flags             |
   | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
   | `CATALOG_PUSH_TOKEN` | the project access token | Masked, Protected |

   If the default branch is protected, either mark the variable as protected
   and allow the token to push to it, or drop the protection on the variable.

5. **Allow the token past branch protection**: _Settings > Repository >
   Protected branches_ — the token's user needs push rights on the default
   branch, and _Protected tags_ must allow it to create tags.

6. **Add the schedule**: _Build > Pipeline schedules > New schedule_, cron
   `0 6 * * 1` (Mondays at 06:00) on the default branch.

7. Optionally set `UPSTREAM_TOKEN` to a GitHub token. It is only needed if the
   instance shares an egress IP with enough other traffic to hit GitHub's
   unauthenticated rate limit of 60 requests per hour.

## Using the published component

Once the first release lands, projects on the instance include it by path:

```yaml
include:
  - component: $CI_SERVER_FQDN/tooark/ci-security-scanner/full-scan@1.3.0
    inputs:
      image: "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA"
      trivy_severity: "CRITICAL,HIGH"
```

`$CI_SERVER_FQDN` resolves to the instance host, so the same snippet works in
every project without hardcoding the domain.

## Moving an existing mirror to this repository

Until 1.2.0 the templates were released from a repository called
`Tooark/ci-security-scanner`. It has since been renamed
[`Tooark/action-security-scanner`](https://github.com/Tooark/action-security-scanner)
and is the GitHub Action only. A mirror set up back then still has
`UPSTREAM_REPO: "Tooark/ci-security-scanner"`; GitHub redirects that name to
the renamed repository, so its `sync` job finds a release without `templates/`
and fails with `upstream release is missing templates`.

Point it here instead. Either edit `UPSTREAM_REPO` in the mirror's
`.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
variables:
  UPSTREAM_REPO: "Tooark/template-ci-security-scanner"
```

or leave the file alone and add `UPSTREAM_REPO` with that value under
_Settings > CI/CD > Variables_ — a project variable wins over the one in the
file. Nothing else changes: the versions already published stay as they are,
and the next `sync` picks up from the newest release here.

## Version mapping

GitHub tags carry a `v` prefix (`v1.0.0`); the catalog expects a bare semantic
version (`1.0.0`). The `sync` job strips the prefix, so upstream `v1.2.3`
becomes catalog version `1.2.3`.
