# Summary

<!--
Explain what this PR does and why. Reference the issue(s) it closes.
Example: "Closes #42 — add trivy_ignorefile to the three Trivy templates."
-->

## Affected area(s)

- [ ] `templates/` — the component templates
- [ ] `catalog-mirror/` — the CI/CD Catalog mirror pipeline
- [ ] `scripts/` and `tests/` — validation run in CI and locally
- [ ] `.github/workflows/` — this repository's own CI
- [ ] `VERSION` — scanner image or component version
- [ ] `docs/` — onboarding guide
- [ ] `examples/` — copy-ready pipelines
- [ ] Governance / documentation only

## Type of change

- [ ] `feat` — new input, new scan, new capability
- [ ] `fix` — bug fix
- [ ] `docs` — documentation only
- [ ] `refactor` — no functional change
- [ ] `build` / `ci` — workflow or tooling change
- [ ] `chore` — version bumps, dependency updates
- [ ] Breaking change (describe it under "Consumer impact")

## Consumer impact

<!--
Does this change what runs inside someone else's pipeline? templates/ does,
and so does catalog-mirror/ for anyone who copies it; .github/workflows/ does
not. Call out anything that raises a requirement on the consumer's side — a new
minimum GitLab version, a changed default, a removed input — and add it to
CHANGELOG.md.
-->

- [ ] No consumer-visible change (this repo's own CI, docs or tooling only)
- [ ] Consumer-visible; described above and recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`

### If this PR adds or renames an input

All four places, or `check-sync.sh` will say so:

- [ ] The template's `spec:inputs` — with `description`, and `options`/`regex` where they apply
- [ ] The template's `variables:` block, as `ARK_IN_*`
- [ ] The job script — exported by `ark_apply_inputs` or read directly, and only when non-empty
- [ ] The input tables of `README.md` and `README.pt-BR.md`
- [ ] The name matches the image variable and the GitHub Action (`snake_case` here, `kebab-case` there)
